black leather wallet (small black object)
[container]
	It's the wallet you found behind the toilet. Beeing made from black leather it appears to have been quite expensive.
	<< !Opened ? You wonder whom it belongs. : Sadly there was no personal information inside. >>
	
porcelain toilet bowl
[fixture, chair]
	Just an ordinary porcelain toilet as it is found in most households since the 18th century.
	Looking at all the water stains it has probably seen better days during its lifetime.
	<< !Wallet ? As his eyes wander around the toilet you notice a small black object lying behind it. >>
	
toilet brush
[thing]
	<<!Taken ? The toilet brush is held by a small plastic receptacle that is mounted to the wall.>>
	It looks more functional than decorative, just like the rest of the room.
	Judging from the all the specks it has collected, it seems like the charwoman visits this place rather seldomly.
	
plastic receptacle on the wall
[decoration]
	The plastic receptacle is mounted to the wall in order to hold the toilet brush in place.
	Apart from the toilet brush it is filled with what looks like rather dirty water.
	
mirror cabinet
[fixture, openablecontainer]
	<< !Open ? Whoever works at this place does not seem to care much for a clean workspace, as the mirror is covered with lots of water stains and other things.
	A thin line in the middle of the mirror separates it into two parts. 
	<< First ? 'Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?'
	Urgh! Its definitely not him... >> :
	A cabinet is mounted inside the wall and covered by the mirror. 
	It is filled with quite a lot of medicine bottles, apart from a vial of Aspirin and some half empty Truxal bottles there is not much you recognize.
	At the bottom of the cabinet lies a razor with some replacement blades, some shaving cream and a rather filthy comb filled with black hair.>>
	
medicine, bottles
[decoration]
	This is quite an impressive collection of various medications. 
	Whomever this belongs certainly has a lot of poblems to attent to.

aspirin
[thing]
	Oh my sweet, sweet ambrosia. Lukily I'm currently not in need of you.
	Would not be useful for me there anyway.

truxal
[thing]
	I can't remember the last time I saw those.
	Judging from the number of half empty bottles, whoever works here is more persistant in taking them then I was.
	
razor
[thing]
	I'm no expert on this, but this razor looks like it should be used for shaving beards.
	There is still some shaving cream left on the blade. Either someone was in a rush or is a bit sloppy.
	
razor blades
[thing]
	A few stacks of replacement blades for the razor. Looks sharp.
	
shaving cream
[thing]
	Nothing special about this shaving cream. It's definitely not the kind that I use though.
